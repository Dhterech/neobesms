# NeoBESMS

NeoBESMS is a modified version of ptr2besms, a tool for modifying lines on PaRappa the Rapper 2. This project adds some features and improves on what it originally did. I made it because I felt the need to and for my own use.

## Changes

* PAL & NTSC-J compatibility (needs testing)
* Functional .OLM file injection
* Shift+F9 for manual PCSX2 base address
* Shift+P to play without ticks
* Better error messages
* Additional info displayed in editor
* Small changes to the code

## Todo

* Make improvements in some areas
* Fix loading 64-bit PCSX2 base address manually
* Check for any audio issues

## Notes

* PAL needs linking of lines to effectively add something
* Project files from one region cannot be loaded onto another (needs testing)
* Expect some bugs for now as this project is very early.
