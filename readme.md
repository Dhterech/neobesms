# NeoBESMS

NeoBESMS is a modified version of ptr2besms, a arealdy known tool in the PaRappa the Rapper 2 community. I made it because I felt the need to and for my own use.

## Changes

I still need to make some more changes to make this software's code good, but I'll list some of that I arealdy made.
* PAL compatibility
* Shift+P to play without ticks
* Better error messages
* Additional info displayed in editor
* Small changes to the code

## Todo

* Make improvements in some areas
* Research about 64-bit PCSX2 loading

## Notes

* PAL needs linking of lines to effectively add something

posesix is the original author of the tool. I only made some changes.
